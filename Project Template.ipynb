    "\n",
    "Note: To put it in short, if there are many outliers then you may consider using Mean Absolute Error (also called the Average Absolute Deviation). RMSE is more sensitive to outliers than the MAE. But when outliers are exponentially rare (like in a bell-shaped curve), the RMSE performs very well and is generally preferred.\n",
